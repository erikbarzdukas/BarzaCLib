Hey

What's up? 

This is a personal project I'm doing  because I love learning computer science concepts in C so much. It's just the last few exercises from Zed Shaw's excellent LCTHW, plus stuff I find elsewhere.

It's probably more of a reference, but I plan on building stuff using the BarzaCLib.
